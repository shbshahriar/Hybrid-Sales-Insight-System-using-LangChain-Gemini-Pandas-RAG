# 🔮 Hybrid Sales Insight System using LangChain + Gemini + Pandas + RAG

This project is a smart hybrid system for **sales data analysis** that combines:
- 🤖 **LLM-based code execution** (via Gemini + Pandas agent) for structured queries
- 📚 **Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG)** (via Chroma + Gemini) for unstructured insights

📊 Designed for extracting **actionable business intelligence** from historical sales datasets — dynamically, flexibly, and intelligently.

---

## 🚀 Features

- 📁 Google Drive integration for easy file access on Colab.
- ⚡ Fast LLM reasoning with **Google Gemini 2.0 Flash Lite**.
- 🧮 **Pandas agent** for Python-powered numeric and tabular analysis.
- 🔍 **RAG pipeline** using vector search + Gemini for rich text generation.
- 🔄 **Automatic query routing** based on keyword analysis.
- 📚 Vector-based document retrieval with **ChromaDB** and **Google Embeddings**.

## 🛠️ Setup

1. **Mount Google Drive**

```python
from google.colab import drive
drive.mount('/content/drive')
```

2. **Install Dependencies**

```bash
!pip install -r '/path/to/your/requirements.txt'
!pip install langchain-experimental
```

3. **Set Your API Key**

```python
import os
os.environ['GOOGLE_API_KEY'] = "your-google-api-key-here"
```

## ⚙️ How It Works

Your query is routed to the right engine based on its intent:

| Query Type      | Routed To           | Example                                      |
|-----------------|---------------------|----------------------------------------------|
| Structured      | Pandas Agent        | `"What is the average sales per branch?"`    |
| Unstructured    | RAG Chain (Gemini)  | `"Describe the sales pattern in the data"`   |

Keyword-based routing logic powers this intelligent flow.

## 🔍 Example Queries

```python
# Structured (Pandas agent)
hybrid_answer("What is the average sales amount per branch?")

# Unstructured (RAG)
hybrid_answer("Describe the sales pattern")

# Time-based insights (RAG)
hybrid_answer("Describe year base sales for all outlet")
```
